There were some issues that I encountered when making this mod. For some reason, whenever I put 
certain xml code into the code, it would completely break the mod. I don't even know how I fixed it,
it just randomely started working. I had to figure out how to do c# coding, which is pretty different
from python. I also had to follow out of date tutorials. I also do not know how to make graphics, I 
am not an artist. In my textures folder, you can see some of my attempts. Overall, I could not be a 
game developer.
