# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Farming mod

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A rimworld mod that improves farming and crop blight. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My mod will improve on the farming system. It will add a fertilizer type item, 
which will speed up growth and crop yield. It will also redo the crop blight system, 
making it less of a random event and more a result of poor farming technique/weather. 
It will be made using C#. I may also add new crops. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will make a fertilizer item and possibly new crops.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will do what was previously said, as well as make crop blight an actual consequence, not just the AI being rude.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will do all that was said, as well as tap into the weather aspect of the game and find a way to apply the rain amount/sunny weather to the speed at which crops grow.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn C#, or at least know enough. I will need to research about crops, both in the game and ones that I might add.
